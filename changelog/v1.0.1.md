# v1.0.1

## What Changed for Miners

- **Worker Name Suffix Support**: Miners can now connect using `{hotkey}.{rig_name}` format for worker names.
  - Example: `5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty.rig001`
  - Multiple rigs under the same hotkey are automatically aggregated
  - All contributions from rigs with the same hotkey prefix are merged for evaluation

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing miners using pure hotkey format continue to work without any changes.

## What Changed for Validators

- **ProxyMetrics Data Aggregation**: Optimized miner matching logic in `get_metrics_timerange()` function.
  - Support both exact match (full hotkey) and suffix match (hotkey.xxx) modes
  - Auto-aggregate hashrate, shares, and share_value in multi-rig scenarios
  - Detailed logging for miner matching and data aggregation process

## Technical Details

- **Modified File**: `dogelayer/core/pool/metrics/dogelayer_proxy.py`
- **Matching Logic**: 
  - Exact match: Full hotkey (e.g., `5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty`)
  - Suffix match: Hotkey with rig name (e.g., `5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty.rig001`)
- **Aggregation**: When multiple rigs share the same hotkey prefix, their hashrate, shares, and share_value are summed
